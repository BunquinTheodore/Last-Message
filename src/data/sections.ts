    text: `Happy New Year.

I've taken my time before writing this, because I wanted every word to come from clarity and intention—not from impulse, emotion, or uncertainty. This year meant a lot to me in ways I didn't expect, and before I step fully into the next one, I wanted to speak honestly and with respect.

This year moved fast. There was growth, pressure, learning, and change. And somewhere in the middle of all that, I met you—in the most unexpected and almost symbolic way. An ID, misplaced in the middle of busy lives, became the starting point of a connection neither of us planned.`

    alt: "A cherished memory",
    text: `It wasn't returned immediately, not because it wasn't important, but because life was happening quickly for both of us. Then, without forcing anything, our paths crossed again in a coffee shop. Two people focused on their own worlds, suddenly intersecting.

That moment stayed with me. Not because it was dramatic, but because it felt natural. Quiet. Honest. Like something that wasn't rushed, but simply allowed to happen.`

    alt: "Getting to know you",
    text: `Getting to know you after that is something I genuinely value. I admire the way you live—with discipline, clarity, and intention. You don't move through life casually. You protect your time, your energy, and your focus. You don't reply just to reply. You don't give attention when it costs you your priorities.

That level of self-respect says a lot about the kind of woman you are.`

    alt: "Your beautiful dreams",
    text: `I admire the way you think about the future—about growth, money, independence, and building something real. The way you speak about your goals, your career, and your vision of living beyond where you are now shows courage and direction.

Dubai isn't just a place you want to go; it represents how far you're willing to take yourself. That mindset left a deep impression on me.`

    text: `And then there are the personal moments—the ones that don't need to be loud to matter. The coffees you treated me to. The adventures you brought me into. Introducing me to your friends. The effort you put into cooking and sharing meals that felt thoughtful and intentional.

Those moments meant something to me. I noticed them. I appreciated them.`

    text: `Thank you as well for listening to my past. For hearing where I came from, what shaped me, and what I've gone through—and for accepting those parts of me without judgment.

That kind of openness is rare, and I don't take it lightly.`

    alt: "Your influence on me",
    text: `You influenced me more than you probably realize. You opened my eyes to real estate, to thinking long-term, to building reputation and discipline instead of chasing shortcuts. You inspired me to take my growth seriously—physically, mentally, and professionally.

Not because you asked me to, but because being around you made me want to rise for myself.`

    text: `I also want to take responsibility where it's needed. If there were moments when I crossed boundaries, disturbed your time, or said things that didn't come out the right way, I'm genuinely sorry.

Thank you for your patience, and for choosing understanding instead of distance.`

    alt: "Honesty and clarity",
    text: `Now, there are a few important things I want to say honestly.

We talked about being friends for now. About going with the flow. About letting things be what they are without forcing labels or outcomes. I've thought deeply about that. And the more I reflected, the more I realized that clarity is kinder than uncertainty.

I respect your time and where you are in life. You're in a season where stability, direction, and long-term decisions matter—and they should. I'm still building. Still studying. Still becoming the man I aim to be. I'm honest enough to admit that I'm not ready yet to commit in the way a woman like you deserves.`

    alt: "Respect and freedom",
    text: `Because of that, I don't want you to feel like you need to wait for me. I don't want to occupy a space in your life that delays the future you're ready for. Your journey matters. Your season matters. And you deserve the freedom to meet someone who is already standing where you're headed, if that's what life brings you.

So I'm choosing to set this boundary—not from fear, and not from distance, but from respect. I believe it's best that we remain friends. Nothing more. Nothing less. No expectations. No waiting. Just honesty and peace.`

    alt: "My real feelings",
    text: `There's one more thing I want to address, because it matters to me.

You once said that what I felt was only attraction. I want you to know, calmly and clearly, that my feelings were real. Attraction may have been the beginning—but it was never the whole story. What I felt came from admiration, respect, and genuine care for who you are and how you live your life.

For me, real feelings don't demand possession. They don't insist on being chosen. They don't try to hold someone back. Real feelings are willing to step aside when that's what's best for the person they care about.

And if one day you choose someone else—someone who is ready, stable, and aligned with the life you want—I accept that. Not with bitterness. Not with resentment. But with sincerity. Because caring for someone also means wanting what's best for them, even when it doesn't include you in the way you once hoped.`

    text: `I won't chase, and I won't compete. But I won't deny the truth either.

I like you. I care about you. And in my own quiet, grounded way, I love you—not as a demand, not as a weight, and not as a condition—but as something honest that I'm at peace carrying.

As I step into this new year, I do so focused, grounded, and clear. No regrets for what I felt. No confusion about where I stand. Just gratitude for what was shared and respect for what lies ahead.

Thank you—for the timing, the lessons, the acceptance, and the moments we shared.

Whatever paths we walk from here, I'm grateful ours crossed the way they did.`
